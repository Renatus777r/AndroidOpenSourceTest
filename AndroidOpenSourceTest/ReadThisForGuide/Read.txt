Welcome to android open source test.

1. Open program
2. Wait for message "Log file created successfully for debugging." (if u dont have this message then something wrong in code or hacked version)
3. Into folder DebuggingCoreLogs copy file log_YEAR-MONTH-DAY to system folder of your custom or offcial rom
4. When all done then flash your rom and all libs will be loaded and fixed (if one lib in your rom was broke like something wrong in code)
5. If something wrong just type report in github! and i will try to fix (DONT FIX YOUSELF)
